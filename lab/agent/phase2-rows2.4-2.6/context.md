You are operating a RHEL-family content server and one host, both on the same machine, a Rocky Linux 9 VM. Run every command on it through:

    limactl shell rhel-lab -- bash -c '<command>'

The user there can sudo without a password.

Layout on the VM (this is how content management works here — versions, environments, a pinned host):

- /srv/content/library/<repo>          what synced from upstream; hosts never see this
- /srv/content/cv/cv-base/<version>/   a published content view version: a frozen snapshot with its own repodata (1.0 and 2.0 exist)
- /srv/content/env/<env>               a lifecycle environment: a symlink to exactly one version (dev, prod)
- environments are served over HTTP:   http://localhost:8080/<env>/<repo>/
- the host is pinned to an environment by /etc/yum.repos.d/lab.repo, whose baseurls point at http://localhost:8080/<env>/...

The package that differs between versions is lab-hello (1.0 in version 1.0; 1.0 and 1.1 in version 2.0).
